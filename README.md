# Welcome to my Networking Portfolio! #
<p>
 This is a place for me to showcase some of the labbing and projects that I've worked on. My goal is to portray my skills
 and demonstrate what I am capable of. Showcases will be built around certain ideas or technology showcases.

 For starters, I would recommend looking at this demonstration of [Basic IP Routing and Services](https://github.com/sweetcriminal/Portfolio/blob/main/Basic%20IP%20Routing%20and%20Services/README.md)
