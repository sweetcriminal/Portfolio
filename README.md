# Welcome to my Networking Portfolio! #

This is a place for me to showcase some of the labbing and projects that I've worked on. My goal is to portray my skills
and demonstrate what I am capable of. Showcases will be built around certain ideas or technology showcases.

For starters, I would recommend looking at this demonstration of [Advanced Routing](https://github.com/sweetcriminal/Portfolio/blob/main/Advanced%20Routing/README.md)
