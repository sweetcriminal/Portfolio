My first showcase is a demonstration of some more advanced routing, including redistribution, multiple routing protocols, as well as a few IP services. 
I've decided to use Cisco Packet Tracer instead of GNS3 or CML because of how quick it is to get things spinning up, as well as not having a limit on the number of running devices.
There is, however, quite a few limitations that I encounter due to this, such as not being able to summarize routes, utilize QoS, use IPSec to protect a GRE tunnel, and much more. It isn't perfect, but it gets the idea accross. 

This is the the starting topology I've decided to represent the internet.

I've decided that I want to use BGP to get things rolling on the internet side of things, but first, some basic IP connectivity is required.
