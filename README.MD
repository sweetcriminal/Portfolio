My first showcase is a demonstration of some more advanced routing, including redistribution, multiple routing protocols, as well as a few IP services.  I've decided to use Cisco Packet Tracer instead of GNS3 or CML because of how quick it is to get things spinning up. There is, however, quite a few limitations that I encounter due to this, such as not being able to summarize routes, utilize QoS, use IPSec to protect a GRE tunnel, and much more. It isn't perfect, but it gets the idea accross. 

This is the the starting topology I've decided to represent the internet.
